# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations

The purpose of this repository is to provide implementations of a variety of common Machine Learning algorithms. The focus of these algorithms is to clearly demonstrate core concepts in Machine Learning, rather than speed or efficiency. 

## The Algorithms
The learning algorithms currently planned to be implemented are:
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- ID3
- Support Vector Machine
- k-Nearest Neighbors

Additionally, common tools for managing data splitting and model evaluation will also be implemented including.
